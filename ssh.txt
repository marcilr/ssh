ssh â€” OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)


ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for
executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to provide secure
encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure
network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets
can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
